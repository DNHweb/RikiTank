#RikiTank
=========
##An original project suggested by the SexyTeam of the Université du Littoral Côte d'Opale - Calais.  

The main purpose of this game is to survive from many opponent's waves. Once you die, your score is updated on the website : www.rikitank.fr.
As you can see, having the highest ELO possible is your goal !

For the moment, the website is under construction, and lot of works still need to be done for the game.

The team is composed of :
* Al3xis : developer, graphist  
* debuss : developer, webmaster  
* thazelart : webmaster, developer  
* eramat : profesor, project manager, Guru
